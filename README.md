# Semantic UI for Spinneret

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A set of [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) components for use
with [Spinneret](https://github.com/ruricolist/spinneret).

Most Semantic UI HTML requires extra HTML scaffolding around it -- this handles
the scaffolding for you. It also abstracts some HTML constructions (such as
tables) to provide a simpler interface that will work for most cases.


## Components

These have been implemented and at least mildly tested.

### Dropdown


### Checkbox


### Field


### Table
